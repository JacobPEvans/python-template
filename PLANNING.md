# Project Status & Planning

## Current Session Progress

### GitHub Workflow Refactoring Plan (In Progress)

**Objective**: Refactor the single `tests.yml` workflow into multiple dedicated-purpose workflows following Python development best practices.

**Current State Analysis**:
- Existing `tests.yml` workflow has mixed responsibilities (testing, linting, type checking)
- Linting/type checking currently uses `continue-on-error: true` which allows broken code to pass
- Need separation of concerns and proper failure handling

**Proposed Workflow Structure**:

1. **`tests.yml`** - Dedicated Python Testing
   - **Purpose**: Run pytest with coverage across Python versions
   - **Name**: "Tests"
   - **Triggers**: push to main/develop, PRs to main
   - **Matrix**: Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
   - **Steps**: checkout → setup Python → install deps → run pytest with coverage → upload coverage (Python 3.12 only)
   - **Behavior**: Fail fast if tests fail

2. **`ci.yml`** - Dedicated Code Quality & Type Checking
   - **Purpose**: Auto-fix then validate code quality
   - **Name**: "Code Quality"
   - **Triggers**: push to main/develop, PRs to main
   - **Matrix**: Single Python version (3.12)
   - **Steps**:
     1. Auto-fixers: black (format), isort (import sort) - commit changes if any
     2. Validators: flake8 (style), mypy (types) - fail workflow if issues found
   - **Behavior**: Must pass completely or workflow fails (remove `continue-on-error`)

**Key Improvements**:
- Separation of concerns: Testing vs Code Quality
- Fail fast: Code quality failures block commits
- Auto-fixing: Black/isort auto-format before validation
- Simplified: Each workflow has single, clear purpose
- Best practices: Follow GitHub Actions naming conventions

**Implementation Plan**:
1. ✅ Set up local pre-commit environment for testing
2. ✅ Update PLANNING.md with detailed plan
3. ✅ Get user acceptance and commit to new branch
4. ✅ Delete existing `tests.yml`
5. ✅ Create new `tests.yml` workflow
6. ✅ Create new `ci.yml` workflow
7. ✅ Test workflows locally and via GitHub Actions

## Repository Context

- **Target**: A modern, robust Python project template.
- **Purpose**: To provide a high-quality starting point for new Python applications, with best practices for tooling, testing, and automation built-in.
- **Tools**: Pytest, GitHub Actions, pre-commit, black, isort, flake8, mypy.

### Key Files

- `pyproject.toml` - The central configuration file for project metadata and tools.
- `src/hello_world/` - The main application package.
- `tests/` - The test suite for the application.
- `.github/workflows/` - The CI/CD pipeline definition.
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `PLANNING.md` - Project documentation.

## Future Improvements

- **Analyze Ruff Integration**: Investigate using Astral's Ruff to potentially replace black, isort, and flake8. The goal is to simplify the
